This Sentiment Analysis of Music App Reviews is my first graduate school class project. In this, me and my team of classmates 
cleaned reviews of 38000+ Amazon, Pandora and Spotify music apps in R and analyzed sentiments using text mining and NLP and 
examined in detail review spikes during holidays, app updates and other major periods.
